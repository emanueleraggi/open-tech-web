Artificial intelligence has already made its way in several applications such as helping in classifying between patients with Parkinson\\u2019s disease and healthy (W. Zeng, C. Yuan, Q. Wang et al., 2019), or by finding the epileptogenic focus for medical treatment in the case of a partial epilepsy by automatically detecting its electroencephalogram signals (W. Zeng et al., 2019). An additional example is given by the possibility of tracking cells\\u2019 trajectory over time, or lineage, as they move (Juang et al., 2009). The aforementioned are just a few of the implementations we can see in the new digital era and new methodologies are currently underway such as how the Brain Machine Interface interacts with a completely motionless patient, or how a BMI interacts with down syndrome patients.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"There are two interesting projects underway such as the \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"https://www.bci2000.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page\"\n  }, \"BCI2000\"), \" which is a general-purpose system for basic and clinical neurophysiological research and the \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"https://openbci.com/\"\n  }, \"OPenBCI project\"), \".

Computing power is more important than ever and GPU-based architecture will allow detectors and sonographers to read scan studies differently, enlarging scope of possibilities and increasing perspective. Challenges with these new architectures involve the required high computing power and the increased memory requested for these operations. Only the most recently developed computers are able to bear that load. However, high computing power comes with a small glitch, which is almost always combined with the higher cost of those machines.
